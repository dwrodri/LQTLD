This is a Python 2.7 implementation of [this paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/89fe/1c4143ab5b2162b5d4caa6c0e863fea42d4b.pdf) from Shimane University. 
I used Python 2.7. This sort of data structure is very useful for path planning, and representing 2-D data where cell adjancency is used frequently.
